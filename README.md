# winnow-parse-error
Shortcut for using annotate-snippets with winnow

## Motivation
In most of my projects using winnow, I like to use annotate-snippets for pretty error messages.
Initially, I ~~stole~~ borrowed the code from [winnow's docs](https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_tutorial/chapter_7/index.html).

## Usage
TODO

## Disclaimer
This crate is not affilated with winnow. I pulled this into it's own crate because its a pattern I repeat a lot.
I'm happy to change the crate name if requested.
